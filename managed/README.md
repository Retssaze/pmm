# Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) management daemon

pmm-managed manages configuration of [PMM](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html)
server components (VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, etc.) and exposes API for that. Those APIs are used by
[pmm-admin tool](https://github.com/percona/pmm-admin).
